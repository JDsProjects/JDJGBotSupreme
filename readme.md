Programmed by many people.

This is bot is designed as a way for people to hangout but first how to use

make an .env file with the config of:

"Discordtoken = <token1>
#token
Discordtoken2= <token>"
#Database info
DB_data = <database uri>
#webhook
webhook1=
#Don't share any of this data
#more data
webhook99 = 


#needs .mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority at the end.(for DB_data)
